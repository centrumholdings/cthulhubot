Buildbot provides an excellent base, but managing large number of bots is tedious. Django-massive-buildbots (DSB) provides further abstraction on top of buildbot and citools to ease creation and management of large number of projects, as well as better monitoring and reporting.

DSB assumes you're controlling all parts of infrastrucutre and utilizes remote access using ssh and sudo privileges. It's not suitable for "buildslave-donated" environments.

DSB is primarily written as managing continuous integration for developing django-based web application in debian environment.

For now, DSB is assuming it runs on same machine as all buildmasters will be generated. Remote masters could be added in the future (aka fork me on github!). 

------------------------
Vocabulary
------------------------
    
    Massive-BuildBot
        In this documentation, it's used mostly as "running project instance using django-massive-buildbot reusable application" instead of "python library".
    
    Project
        Represents either one application (in django sense, i.e. library) or project (meaning "deployed page"). Project can be depend on other and have responsible people associated. It has at least one buildmaster (this is tool for handling CI, not Trac).
        
    Build Computer
        Computer with POSIX operating system (nothing else supported for now; Debian have special flavor), remotely controllable by django-massive-buildbot. We're assuming it's dedicated for buildbots job and massive-buildbot is sudo-priveledged for some operations, called remotely by ssh with no-password key authentication.
    
    Buildmaster
        As in BuildBot; coordinating server porgram assigned set of buildslaves. It's using configuration generated by massive-buildbot and it's coordinated by it, have two dedicated port (coordination port for slaves and for waterfall page view).
    
    Buildslave
        As in BuildBot; client process running on Build Computer, connecting to correct Buildmaster port and listening to it's commands.
    
    Job
        In BuildBots speech: named factory. For normal people: sequence of (mostly) shell commands with assigned name, so they can be used across projects. 

------------------------
Software stages
------------------------

DSB heavily uses "named factory", i.e. abstration of top of buildbot's factory. Each named factory is just sequence of configurable commands, executed in order and bound by some rules (locks etc.). Important named factories are:
    
* package build (and upload and master ping)
* documentation build (and upload)
* test run
* webtests run (and configuration of live port and selenium proxy)
