Cthulhu bot
============

Slightly more evil tentacles of Cthulhu, ruling over poor buildbot slaves.

Project for managing large number of buildbots for web development, with some useful whistles. WIP, come back later.

Dependencies for running:
 * Buildbot 0.7.11
 * buildbot-mongodb-status 0.3

For development
 * django-sane-testing for tests (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangosanetesting/)
 * django-cpserver (http://github.com/lincolnloop/django-cpserver/) as usual devserver will not work
