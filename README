CthulhuBot
============

Slightly more evil tentacles of Cthulhu, ruling over poor buildbot slaves.

Project for managing large number of buildbots for web development, with some useful whistles. WIP, site & docs coming soon.

Trac is located at http://devel.almad.net/trac/cthulhubot , mailing list on librelist (cthulhubot@librelist.com).

Dependencies for running:
 * Buildbot 0.7.11
 * buildbot-mongodb-status 0.3
 * paramiko
 * django-http-digest

For development
 * django-sane-testing for tests (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangosanetesting/)
 * django-cpserver (http://github.com/lincolnloop/django-cpserver/) as usual devserver will not work
